## Session: Narrative Continuity Observability System (v1.58.0)

**Session Date:** April 19, 2026
**Outcome:** v1.58.0 complete — full-stack diagnostic visibility for the Narrative Continuity System shipped across three files

### What Was Built

**NarrativeContinuity.js — Diagnostic API (Phase A)**
- Module-level `_diagnostics` accumulator: `{ alerts[], rejection_reason, entity_updates_applied[], entity_continuity_cleared[] }`
- `resetDiagnostics()` — hard overwrite per turn; no carry-forward; called exactly once by index.js before checkEviction
- `pushAlert(alert)` — shared entry point for engine-owned events (index.js) and Critical-class extraction failures (internal)
- `getLastRunDiagnostics()` — returns frozen copy of all 4 fields; called by index.js after freeze to inject into narration_debug
- `checkEviction` return extended: `{ evicted: bool, reason: string|null }` — reason built from `reasonParts.join('+')`
- All `runContinuityExtraction` `return null` paths now classify and record `rejection_reason`:
  - Critical (+ pushAlert): `focus_integrity_mismatch`, `missing_required_field:active_continuity`, `missing_required_field:player_locomotion`, `missing_required_field:player_physical_state`, `missing_required_field:tone`, `missing_required_field:interaction_mode`, `missing_required_field:interaction_status`, `missing_required_field:environment_continuity`, `missing_required_field:entity_updates`
  - Warning (rejection_reason only): `empty_response`, `json_parse_failed`, `api_timeout`, `api_error`
- `freezeContinuityState` — entity update loop pushes npc_id to `entity_updates_applied`; ephemeral clear loop pushes to `entity_continuity_cleared`
- `module.exports` extended: adds `resetDiagnostics`, `pushAlert`, `getLastRunDiagnostics`

**index.js — 5 Touch Points (Phase B)**
- `NC.resetDiagnostics()` before `checkEviction` — hard invariant: exactly once per turn
- `checkEviction` destructure: `{ evicted: _continuityEvicted, reason: _continuityEvictionReason }` + eviction pushAlert (severity: Info)
- `_continuityBlockSnapshot` captured immediately after `buildContinuityBlock` — `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(active_continuity))` or null
- NAME GUARD reject: added `NC.pushAlert({ severity: 'Critical', type: 'learned_name_violation', entity_ref: `${name} (${id})` })` after existing `console.warn`
- `narration_debug` in turnObject extended: `continuity_snapshot: _continuityBlockSnapshot`, `continuity_diagnostics: NC.getLastRunDiagnostics()`

**Index.html — Panels, Functions, Cleanup (Phase C)**
- `#continuityPanel` (below `#diagnostics`): extraction status row, active_continuity field summary (7 fields), entity update/clear ids, alert lifecycle badges (New/Ongoing/Resolved), entity display cache (last seen N turns ago)
- `#continuityLogsPanel` (below `#logsPanel`): rolling one-line log per turn; buffer 1000 entries (shift); DOM renders last 200; Copy Continuity Log button
- "Copy Story" button in `#logsPanel`: `[...turn_history].reverse()` → extract `.narrative` → join with `---` separator
- `renderContinuityPanel(data)` — rebuilds `#continuity-live` each turn; owns alert lifecycle management
- `appendContinuityLogEntry(data)` — appends text entry to buffer, re-renders DOM
- `_entityDisplayCache` — `{}` keyed by npc_id; retains last narrative_state even after ephemeral clears; shows "N turns ago"
- `_continuityAlertHistory` — Set of `type:entity_ref` keys; drives New/Ongoing/Resolved badge per turn
- Session cleanup hook in `data.diagnostics?.first_turn`: resets buffer, cache, alert history, clears both DOM panels
- `buildTurnBlock` narration_debug section extended: `-- Continuity` section with extraction result, rejection reason, alert count + types, entity ids

### Files Changed
| File | Sections |
|---|---|
| `NarrativeContinuity.js` | Header; new diagnostic accumulator + 3 functions; `checkEviction` return; `runContinuityExtraction` all null paths; `freezeContinuityState` entity loops; `module.exports` |
| `index.js` | Before `checkEviction`; `checkEviction` destructure; after `_continuityBlock` build; NAME GUARD block; `narration_debug` in turnObject |
| `Index.html` | `#continuityPanel` HTML; `#continuityLogsPanel` HTML; Copy Story button; `renderContinuityPanel()`; `appendContinuityLogEntry()`; `copyStory()`; state vars; session cleanup; `buildTurnBlock` narration_debug extension |

### Research Findings (Pre-Implementation)
- `active_continuity` reaches the frontend via `response.state.world` — immediately available client-side
- 4 NC debug fields in `narration_debug` (injected/extraction_success/evicted/block_chars) were already present
- Server console logs are not forwarded to frontend — diagnostic accumulator is the correct bridging mechanism
- No per-turn snapshot existed before this version — `continuity_snapshot` in narration_debug is the first implementation
- Rejection reasons were fully invisible to the frontend before this version

## Session: QA Bug-Fix Pass v2 (v1.44.0)

**Session Date:** April 19, 2026
**Outcome:** v1.44.0 complete — four runtime QA failures fixed, pending-say converted to true modal overlay

### Issues Fixed

**Phase 1 — NPC bracket-counting parse (index.js Phase 5F)**
- Root cause: regex `/\[npc_updates:\s*(\[[\s\S]*\])\s*\]/` failed when model emitted non-whitespace between inner `]` and outer `]`. NPC name updates silently discarded.
- Fix: second bracket-counting pass anchored at tag index 13. Strict whitespace-only skip before inner `[`. Clean failure + full `_nuRaw` log on any other character. `JSON.parse` on counted inner slice directly.

**Phase 2 — Do-path FREEFORM degradation (index.js validation gate)**
- Root cause: `TARGET_NOT_FOUND_IN_CELL` and `TARGET_NOT_VISIBLE` caused unconditional `_abortTurn` → `"Action invalid: reason"` with no narration.
- Fix: intercept those two codes only, reclassify to FREEFORM, skip queue loop via `_degradedToFreeform` flag, fall through to `if (!engineOutput)` guard → `Engine.buildOutput`. Talk intercept unaffected (it lives inside the skipped queue loop).

**Phase 3 — L1 narration local-space flavor bleed (index.js narration prompt)**
- Root cause: model imported smell/atmosphere from `_siteContextBlock` local spaces into outdoor L1 description.
- Fix: P3-A extended LAYER CONSTRAINT string; P3-B added L1-conditional bottom bullet. Both target `_narDepth >= 2` / `_narDepth === 2` respectively.

**Phase 4 — Parser talk/enter ambiguity (SemanticParser.js buildPrompt)**
- Root cause: zero `talk` pattern examples; `enter` had explicit "to [X]" examples; "walk over and talk to X" → `enter X`.
- Fix: `enter` guardrail (person target → `talk`; object target → `examine`/`take`); new `talk` pattern line with three concrete examples.

**Phase 5 — Pending-say true modal overlay (Index.html)**
- Root cause: `#pendingSayPrompt` was an inline widget inside `#inputBars` — no backdrop, no focus trap, no Escape.
- Fix: converted to `position: fixed` full-screen overlay (z-index 300). Focus-trapped via `keydown` listener. Toggled via `.active` class. Removed from input bar DOM entirely.

### Files Changed
| File | Sections |
|---|---|
| `index.js` | Phase 5F NPC parse block; validation gate; L1 LAYER CONSTRAINT; L1 bottom bullet |
| `SemanticParser.js` | `buildPrompt` USER_TEXT — `enter` guardrail + `talk` pattern line |
| `Index.html` | CSS pending-say modal rules; HTML structure; `classList` toggle; `keydown` focus-trap listener |

## Session: Problem Discovery → Logging Infrastructure (Phase A)

**Session Date:** March 26-27, 2026
**Outcome:** Phase A logging infrastructure complete and deployed

---

## Session Evolution: The Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Bug Fix (Previous Session)

**Problem:** Settlement names were repeating (Whiteglen, Fairbridge everywhere)  
**Solution:** Integrated semantic location detection using DeepSeek  
**Result:** Unique settlement names via AI understanding of world type

### Phase 2: Interactive Debugging Console (Previous Session)

**Request:** "Build a way to talk directly to DeepSeek"  
**Implementation:** Created `/ask-deepseek` endpoint + frontend UI  
**Result:** Interactive debug console for querying game state

### Phase 3: The Epistemological Crisis (This Session - Discovery)

**Observation:** Testing revealed DeepSeek fabricates information
- Asked: "What's the grid size?"
- DeepSeek guessed: "10x10"
- Actual: "8x8"

**Critical Question:** "How do we know anything is real in the game?"

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Narrative-only interfaces are fundamentally unverifiable
- No ground truth layer
- No audit trail of what actually happened
- Can't distinguish between fiction and fact

**Consulting GPT-4.5:**
- Confirmed: "You don't have a ground truth layer"
- Validated approach: Logging should be foundational, not optional
- Suggested: Phase A (proof concept) before Phase B (persistence)

### Phase 4: Architecture Design (Discussion & Agreement)

**Proposed Approach:**

**Phase A: Event Streaming**
- Real-time structured events
- Console output (colored for visibility)
- In-memory buffering
- File persistence (JSON)
- Browser UI for management

**Phase B: Database + Query** (Future)
- SQLite persistence
- Query endpoints
- Session summaries
- Advanced filtering

**User Green-Light:** "green light!!! 🟢🟢🟢. let's goooooo! to glory!"

### Phase 5: Implementation (This Session - Execution)

#### Step 1: Core Logger Module
- Created `logger.js` (150+ lines)
- Structured event system with categories
- ANSI color formatting
- Factory pattern: `createLogger(config)`
- Event buffer + flush mechanism

#### Step 2: Server Integration
- Modified `index.js` to wire logger throughout
- Fixed duplicate `fs` declaration issue
- Events logged at critical points:
  - Session lifecycle
  - World generation
  - Action parsing
  - Player movement
  - NPC spawning
  - Narration generation

#### Step 3: Log Management
- Added 4 REST endpoints:
  - `/logs/flush` - Save session to disk
  - `/logs/list` - Browse all saved logs
  - `/logs/read/:sessionId` - Read specific log
  - `/logs/download/:sessionId` - Download as file

#### Step 4: Frontend UI
- Added "SESSION LOGS" panel to game interface
- Implemented 4 interactive buttons:
  - 💾 Flush - Save current session
  - ⬇️ Download - Get JSON file
  - 📂 List - See all logs
  - 👁️ View - Display current session

#### Step 5: File Persistence
- Automatic `/logs` directory creation
- Timestamped session files: `session_[id].json`
- Complete event history per session
- Human-readable JSON format

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Real-Time Console Output

**Why:** Provides immediate visibility during development  
**Trade-off:** Performance impact minimal, huge debugging value  
**Result:** Can watch events stream as they happen

### Decision 2: Colored ANSI Output

**Why:** Makes different event categories visually distinct  
**Category → Color Mapping:**
- SESSION: Cyan (session lifecycle)
- WORLD_GEN: Green (generation logic)
- BIOME: Magenta (biome detection)
- LOCATION: Yellow (location detection)
- ENGINE: Blue (core engine)
- MOVEMENT: Cyan (player movement)
- NPC: Green (NPC systems)
- SETTLEMENT: Yellow (settlements)
- NARRATION: Magenta (narration)
- ERROR: Red (problems)

### Decision 3: JSON File Format (Not Binary)

**Why:** Human-readable, debuggable, shareable  
**Alternative Considered:** SQLite  
**Rationale:** Phase A needed to validate event model first  
**Future:** Phase B will use SQLite for querying

### Decision 4: Browser Download Feature

**Why:** Render files aren't locally accessible  
**Solution:** Add download endpoint  
**Result:** Logs can come to local machine for analysis  
**Bonus:** Files can be stored in local `/logs/` for symbiotic AI analysis

### Decision 5: Per-Session Logger Instance

**Why:** Isolates events by session  
**Structure:** Logger stored in session state (`sessionStates.get(sessionId)`)  
**Benefit:** Multiple concurrent sessions don't interfere

### Decision 6: Event Emission at State Transitions (Not Implementation)

**Why:** Avoid noise and focus on "what changed"  
**Bad:** Log every function call, every loop iteration  
**Good:** Log when biome is detected, player moves, NPC spawns  
**Philosophy:** "Observable facts, not internal workings"

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: Duplicate `fs` Declaration

**Symptom:** `SyntaxError: Identifier 'fs' has already been declared`  
**Root Cause:** Line 2 had `const fs = require('fs')`, line 41 had `const fs = require('fs').promises`  
**Solution:** 
- Keep line 2 as `const fs = require('fs')` (sync version)
- Line 41 as `const fsPromises = require('fs').promises` (async version)
- Updated all async calls to use `fsPromises`
**Learning:** Be explicit about sync vs async file operations

### Problem 2: Logs on Remote Server Only

**Symptom:** Deployed to Render, but logs only exist there  
**Root Cause:** No way to access Render's filesystem directly  
**Solution:** 
- Added download endpoint
- Frontend button to trigger browser download
- Users can move files locally or share content
**Result:** Logs become accessible for analysis

### Problem 3: Initial Directory Structure Assumptions

**Symptom:** `/logs` directory didn't exist  
**Solution:** Logger auto-creates directory on first run  
**Code:** `fs.mkdirSync(logsDir, { recursive: true })`  
**Result:** Zero manual setup required

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Observability Over Implementation**
   - Log "what changed," not "what ran"
   - Emit facts, not commentary

2. **Real-Time + Persistent**
   - Console for immediate feedback
   - Files for persistent audit trail

3. **Categories Over Flat Lists**
   - Organize events logically
   - Easier filtering in Phase B

4. **Structured Over Free-Form**
   - JSON schema for each event
   - Enables reliable querying

5. **Ground Truth Over Narrative**
   - Events are facts
   - Narratives are generated from facts

---

## Next Steps (Phase B)

### Planned Work

1. **SQLite Persistence**
   - Migrate from JSON to relational DB
   - Enable complex queries
   - Support aggregations

2. **Advanced Querying**
   - Filter by category, level, time
   - Search events by keyword
   - Get session summaries

3. **Event Analysis Tools**
   - What happened in session?
   - Did action X succeed?
   - What errors occurred?

4. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Event filtering UI
   - Session comparison
   - Event timeline visualization

5. **Automated Analysis**
   - AI reads logs automatically
   - Generates diagnostic reports
   - Suggests fixes

---

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Separation of Concerns Matters**
   - Logger module ≠ server code
   - Makes testing and reuse easier

2. **Async/Sync File Operations**
   - Be explicit about which you're using
   - Don't mix them with same constant name

3. **Category-Based Organization**
   - Beats flat event lists
   - Works well for coloring and filtering

4. **Real-Time Visibility**
   - Console output during dev is invaluable
   - Colored output adds little cost, huge value

### Architectural Lessons

1. **Phase Approach Works**
   - Phase A proved event model
   - Phase B can add persistence confidently
   - Reduces risk of overbuilding

2. **Ground Truth Is Foundational**
   - Can't debug without knowing what happened
   - Structured events are cheap insurance

3. **File Format Flexibility**
   - JSON today, SQLite tomorrow
   - Both can coexist during transition

---

## Collaboration Notes

### What Worked Well

- **Iterative Problem Solving:** Identified problem → discussed approach → built solution
- **Clear Requirements:** User stated needs upfront (want logs locally, want to download, etc.)
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Went from concept to deployed in one session
- **Good Testing:** Caught issues on Render immediately

### Communication Patterns

- Short, focused questions from user
- Comprehensive context-gathering from assistant
- Rapid iteration on feedback
- Clear summary after each phase

---

## Conclusion

**What We Built:** A production-ready structured logging system solving the fundamental problem of game state verification.

**Impact:** 
- No more "trust me, it works"
- Objective audit trail of all critical events
- Foundation for deeper analysis and debugging
- Enables AI assistant to independently verify claims

**Next:** Phase B will make logs queryable and analytical, but Phase A proves the core concept works.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for real-world use and testing
